Deploy to Github Pages
```
gulp deploy
```

Deploy to AWS S3 (install [s3_website gem](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) first.)

Stylesheets, images, fonts, and javascript files go in the `/source/assets/` directory.
Vendor stylesheets and javascripts should go in each of their `/vendor/` directories.
The source folders for images and fonts have a `.keep` file in them so they can be in the repo, but you can remove those files.
